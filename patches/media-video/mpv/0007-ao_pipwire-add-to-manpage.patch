+    The following global options are supported by this audio output:
+
+    ``--pipewire-buffer-samples=<n>``
+        Set the audio buffer size in samples. A higher value buffers
+        more data, and has a lower probability of buffer underruns. A smaller
+        value makes the audio stream react faster, e.g. to playback speed
+        changes.
+        The effective size of the buffer depends on the amount of buffered
+        samples and the samplerate.
